## Intro

Hey, have you heard of the bi0s Cybersecurity Meetup, also known as bi0s Meetups? It's a monthly event put together by team bi0s, which is India's top CTF team. I got to work on the design system and website for these meetups, allowing participants to easily sign up online. I've been handling this project on my own because we have a small team—everyone else was busy with speakers and venues, so I took on the website to lighten their load for just one event.

Our first three meetups took place on campus, but we soon aimed for bigger venues. The first off-campus meetup was at Flipkart's office, where we had a talk by Flipkart's CISO. It was a turning point for us, prompting us to elevate our efforts. I introduced a design concept that received great feedback, and we decided to use this style for all our future meetups.

## Designing the website

So, we all agreed to keep the website's look consistent. It took me almost a week to finish the design, set up the site, and pick the content. Since this was my first big project, I'm thinking of writing a blog about the process and why I made those decisions.

The entire website got rewritten twice. At first, I used Astro, but since it's a niche framework, I realized it might be hard for others to manage the site later on. So, I switched to Next.js. This was also the first site I created entirely from scratch, no templates or themes used.

Apart from the awesome dynamic themes using CSS variables — check out `https://bi0smeetup.in/meetups/8` and play around with the number 8, going down to 1 — and the custom shadcn UI components that perfectly fit the site's theme, there's not a lot more to say about the frontend.

So, the website is actually built using a full TypeScript stack. We use Prisma and Neon PostgreSQL db for data storage, and Next Auth for authentication. Our aim was to set up something like Luma but with more control over our development. If you take a look at the user experience flow, you'll see it's similar to Luma, and we did borrow some of their UI too. And hey, if anyone from Luma is reading this, you all made an awesome web app! However, because of our design scheme, we had to start from scratch.

## Starting with data storage

Back when we didn't have authentication, we simply took form responses and added them to Prisma. We relied on the `useLocalStorage` hook for state management. I realize this wasn't ideal as it impacted everything. It was also inefficient because a user could forget they registered for an event and try to register again from a different device. Since the venue provider had limited seats, we had to opt for authentication.

So, I decided to go with React Hook Form and Zod for form validation because they're super light and easy to use. Zod's validation based on schemas is neat and lets me handle all validation in one place, which I find better than dealing with it in each input field separately.

I went with `useLocalStorageState` to check user registration. It's a super handy hook for keeping state in sync with local storage, even surviving page refreshes. This ensures users don't lose their registration info if they accidentally refresh, a nice touch for user experience.

In hindsight, it turned out to be a bad idea. Users can't tell if they registered from different devices, and without an expiry date, the next meetup page might still show you as registered.

Working with various meetups, I utilized the URL slug to dynamically load specific information for each event—such as fonts, colors, and descriptions. This allows each event page to have its own unique style while maintaining the site's consistency. Also, manually hard-coding all meetups would have been cumbersome—it's much easier to manage and scale this way.

## so what's next? Auth?

Let's talk about UX. I'm not someone who delved into human philosophy to grasp user experience, but having to fill out forms every time during testing made me question its necessity. There was a point when we debated the need for authentication on a meetup page that simply displayed event information. However, we realized authentication was essential for future paid workshops, setting a strong foundation. Meetups will always remain free, but we aim to provide workshop materials exclusively to attendees rather than making them public—although with some website tinkering, you could still access them.

The code is pretty much copied from the Next Auth docs website and adjusted to include onboarding features that will be added later. We plan to request users for their phone number, preferably WhatsApp, to send an RSVP message via the bot. Also, we'd like to collect LinkedIn profiles to understand the industry and university distribution of our users.


## stuff like emails and QR

We wanted to make signing up even easier by sending confirmation emails right after users register. We used **Resend** with **React Email** to send personalized emails. This gives users instant confirmation and adds a nice touch to the experience.  
  
Additionally, we came up with a cool idea for event management - a **QR code check-in system**. Users receive a unique QR code in their confirmation email, allowing them to check in by simply scanning it at the event. This speeds up the check-in process, makes it contactless, and helps us keep track of attendance efficiently. By automating emails and using QR codes, we're streamlining our processes and ensuring smooth operations on event day.

## Conclusion

Working on this website for bi0s Meetups has been so fulfilling. I've picked up a ton of new skills, from creating a system that's both practical and visually appealing to handling data storage and improving user experience with features like authentication, emails, and QR code check-ins. It really made me rethink how event registration and management should be done, and I'm really happy with the result. Each obstacle was a chance to learn something fresh, whether it was about frontend design or backend choices to ensure the platform can grow smoothly. I'm really looking forward to what's next and how this project will keep evolving as our meetups expand!
